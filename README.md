This Phyton program uses an if-elif-else structure to classify individuals according to their age.  I simply used Carnets and a handout that my professor gave me to construct this. In this exercise, students will use an if-elif-else structure to construct a function that classifies individuals according to their age. The function, named classify_age(age), will take an age as input and classify individuals into four groups: Child (0-12 years), Teen (13-19 years), Adult (20-64 years), and Senior (65+ years). If an invalid age (negative number) is entered, the function should print an appropriate message. Students will call this function multiple times with different age values to observe how the program categorizes different individuals. For example, calling classify_age(8) should print "You are a Child.", while classify_age(70) should print "You are a Senior.". This exercise will help students understand function definitions, parameter usage, and conditional statements in Python.
